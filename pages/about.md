## What Were World Expositions?
World Expositions emerged in the mid-19th century as grand international exhibitions designed to showcase technological innovations, cultural achievements, and national progress. 

Born from the Industrial Revolution's need to display new inventions and foster international trade, these events became platforms for peaceful competition between nations and public education on a massive scale.

## Why These Four Expositions?
This collection focuses on four pivotal exhibitions that represent key moments in technological and social transformation:

1. London 1851: The first international exhibition, establishing the template for future world's fairs.

2. Philadelphia 1876: America's industrial coming-of-age and early women's rights activism.

3. Paris 1889: Architectural triumph and imperial showcase with lasting cultural icons. 

4. Chicago 1893: Urban planning revolution and the dawn of the electric age.

## Critical Perspectives
While celebrating technological progress, these expositions also reinforced social hierarchies, colonial exploitation, and racial discrimination. Our exhibition examines both the innovations and the controversies, including:

1. Colonial "human zoos" and cultural appropriation 
2. Women's struggles for representation and recognition
3. Racial exclusion and ethnographic exploitation
4. Class divisions in access and participation 

## Innovation and Progress
Each exposition showcased cutting-edge technology, from steam power to electricity, marking humanity's rapid advancement through the Industrial Revolution.

## Power and Representation
World's fairs served as stages for nations to assert dominance and project cultural values, often at the expense of marginalized communities.

## Legacy and Memory
These expositions left lasting impacts on urban development, international relations, and collective memory, while their controversial aspects were often forgotten or romanticized.
